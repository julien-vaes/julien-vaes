I am a DPhil student in the [Numerical Analysis Group](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysism) at the University of Oxford, and I am affiliated with Worcester College. I am also part of The Alan Turing Institute.

Here is the list of my projects:

* A [Julia code](https://github.com/julien-vaes/trading_uncertain_volume) for calculating the optimal execution strategy of a risk-averse trader subject to an uncertain volume target. The code is associated with the paper [Optimal execution strategy with an uncertain volume target](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11454).
